## Setup

To get started with the TaskMaster Android app:

1. Create a new directory and repo named "taskmaster."

2. Use Android Studio to set up a new app following the instructions discussed in class.

3. Clone this repository and open the project in Android Studio.

4. Run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device to see the main page with navigation buttons.

## Features

### Homepage

The main page of the app now includes a dynamic RecyclerView to display the lists of tasks, making it easy for users to view and manage their tasks. This replaces the previous approach of three hardcoded task buttons. Users can tap on a task to navigate to the "Task Detail" page.

### Task Detail Page:
- Display task title, description, and status.

### Settings Page:
- Allow users to enter and save their usernames.

### Add a Task

On the "Add a Task" page, users can input details about a new task, including a title and a body. Clicking the "submit" button saves the task in the local database and displays a "submitted!" label on the page.

### All Tasks

The "All Tasks" page currently features a back button and will be enhanced to display tasks from the local database, allowing users to view all their tasks at a glance.


## Espresso Testing
1. **Assert Important UI Elements**:
  - UI elements that are crucial for the app's functionality are verified to be displayed on the page, ensuring a seamless user experience.

2. **Task Detail Display Test**:
  - A test has been added to tap on a task, and the resulting activity is tested to ensure that it displays the name of the selected task correctly.

3. **Username Edit Test**:
  - The user's ability to edit their username has been tested, and it is verified that the updated username is correctly displayed on the homepage.
