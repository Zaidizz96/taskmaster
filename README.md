## Features

## AWS Amplify Integration

We have integrated AWS Amplify to add cloud functionality to our TaskMaster app. Here's what we did on Day 6:

### Homepage

- We refactored the homepage's RecyclerView to display all Task entities from DynamoDB. That are related to the user settings assigned team

### Task Detail Page:
- Display task title, description, and status.

### Settings Page:
- Allow users to enter and save their usernames. in addition to the ability for the user to specify the team name that he wants relative tasks to be appeared in the home page 

### Add a Task

- We modified the "Add Task" form to save the data entered as a Task to DynamoDB. When users add a new task, it's now stored in the cloud. alongside the capability for users to assign this task for a specific team

### All Tasks

The "All Tasks" page currently features a back button and will be enhanced to display tasks from the local database, allowing users to view all their tasks at a glance.

### Edit Tasks

- we create new page activity (edit task) for allowing the users to edit their task info

## User Authentication with AWS Cognito

We have integrated AWS Cognito to enhance the security and user authentication of our TaskMaster app. Here's a summary of the new features:

### User Login

- AWS Cognito is now part of our Amplify setup, providing a secure authentication mechanism.
- Users can log in using the pre-built Cognito UI, ensuring a seamless and secure login experience.
- The logged-in user's username is displayed on relevant pages, offering a personalized experience.

### User Logout

- Implemented a user logout functionality, allowing users to securely log out of the application.

### Uploads

- On the "Add a Task" activity, users can now optionally select an image to attach to a task.
- If an image is attached, it will be uploaded to S3 and associated with the task.

### Displaying Files

- On the Task detail activity, if there is an image associated with a particular task, it will be displayed within that activity.

### Adding a Task from Another Application

- Added an intent filter to the "Add a Task" activity, enabling users to share images from other apps.
- Users can hit the "share" button on an image in another app, choose TaskMaster, and be taken directly to the "Add a Task" activity with the image pre-selected.





## Espresso Testing
1. **Assert Important UI Elements**:
  - UI elements that are crucial for the app's functionality are verified to be displayed on the page, ensuring a seamless user experience.

2. **Task Detail Display Test**:
  - A test has been added to tap on a task, and the resulting activity is tested to ensure that it displays the name of the selected task correctly.

3. **Username Edit Test**:
  - The user's ability to edit their username has been tested, and it is verified that the updated username is correctly displayed on the homepage.
